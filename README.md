# Bash scripts repository
## A repository for various bash scripts so that I never lose them again!
Sometimes I build a script, and that script might be useful for something, but eventually gets burried in the file system and I can never find it again when I need it.
So I created this repository so that I can keep my bash scripts here, to hopefuly stop the endless cycle of re-creating something that I've already built before.
